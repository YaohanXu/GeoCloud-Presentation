title: "Add a chart showing the distribution of assessed property values based on the most recent assessment year"
labels: ["Front-end"]
---

The chart will use the data in the `/configs/tax_year_assessment_bins.json` in the public bucket. I recommend choosing a library such as [Apex Charts](https://apexcharts.com/) or [C3](https://c3js.org/), but the library is up to you.

**Acceptance criteria:**
- [ ] A bar chart or smoothed line chart showing the number of properties that fell into each of the price bins during the most recent tax assessment year.
