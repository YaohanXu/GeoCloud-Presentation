The code (HTML, JS, CSS) for the assessments reviewer interface should all live under the `ui/reviewer/` folder. Refer to the [project slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QZ6gXKYuN3Uk1owGHLrKVhh0EbPUGKQf9-VEnpnaCE4/edit) to review the wireframes.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] A file named `index.html` in the `ui/reviewer/` folder
- [ ] A stylesheet (.css) file with the basic layout of the page, as shown in the [wireframe](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1XRS2O_0IJNv2jknYMHfWHBhhqFn0e2gyK_vgbQMAUKg/edit?usp=sharing)
